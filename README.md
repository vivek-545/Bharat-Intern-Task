# Task 1
## Problem statement :

## Titanic Classification : Algorithm which tells whether the person will be save from sinking or not
### About Dataset :
Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we have to a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

PassengerId: Passenger Identity	
Survived: Whether passenger survived or not	(0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass:	Class of ticket, a proxy for socio-economic status (SES)	(1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name:	Name of passenger	
Sex:	Sex of passenger	
Age:	Age of passenger in years	
SibSp: Number of sibling and/or spouse travelling with passenger	
Parch:	Number of parent and/or children travelling with passenger	
Ticket: Ticket number	
Fare: Price of ticket	
Cabin: Cabin number	
Embarked: Port of embarkation	(C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
